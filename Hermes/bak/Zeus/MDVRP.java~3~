/**
 * <p>Title: Zeus - Unified Object Oriented Model for Routeing and Schdeduling Problems</p>
 * <p>Description:  The MDVRP, Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, consists of more than one
 *    depot used in solving a routing problem. A set of customers are to be serviced from
 *    multiple depots using trucks that can be used from any depot. The objective of the problem
 *    is to service the customers by first minimizing the total number of trucks required from
 *    each depot and second minimizing the total distance traveled by the trucks. The constraint
 *    is not to exceed the total capacity of the truck. </p>

           The next step is to go to the next depot and allocate the a customer closest to that depot to
           a truck. This process will loop through all the depots and sequentially allocate customers to the
