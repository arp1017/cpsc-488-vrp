 * <p>Title: Zeus - Unified Object Oriented Model for Routeing and Schdeduling Problems</p>
 * <p>Description: The ProblemInfo class is used to maintain information on the current problem being solved. All
 * aspects of the problem such as the number of depots, number of trucks, number of shipments, the single depot
 * coordinates, maximum capacity, maximum distance, name of the data file are kept in this class. This is a static
 * class and as such does not require to be instantiated thus allowing infomation to be accessed using the name
 * of the class followed by the variable name, e,g ProblemInfo.fileName.
 *
 * This class is also used to define instances of the costfunctions that are to be used in the problme being solved</p>
