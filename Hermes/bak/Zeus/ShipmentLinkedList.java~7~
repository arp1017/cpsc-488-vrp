/**
 * <p>Title: Zeus - Unified Object Oriented Model for Routeing and Schdeduling Problems
 * <p>Description:  The ShipmentLinkedList class maintains information on all the shipments
 * that are avaiaible for the problem. The ShipmentLinkedList class is a collection of
 * instances form the Shipment class. For a problem, all the shipment information is read
 * in and placed in the ShipmentLinkedList class. The presence of a shipment in the
 * ShipmentLinkedList class indicates that it is routed in the problem. This class should not
 * be used for any other purpose than for maintaining shipment information. That is, routing shipments and
 * deleting it from this class is prohibited. Deleting a shipment form this class indicates that the
 * shipment does not exist. All shipments being routing in the problem have to be present in this class
 * all the time. </p>
