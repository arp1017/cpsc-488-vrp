 * <p>Title: Zeus - A Unified Object Oriented Model for Routing and Scheduling Problems</p>
 * <p>Description: The root class is the root node for accessing all the classes in the Zeus
 *    system. The root creates an instance class of the problem to be solved. If the problem
 *    to be solved is the multi-depot vehicle routing problem, a MDVRP class is created serves
 *    as the interface for solving the MDVRP problem. If the problem to be solved is the Tour
 *    Orientering Problem then a TOP class is created. The root class in only involved in
 *    creating an instance of the problem class to be solved, such as MDVRP, and then delegates
 *    the MDVRP class to take over the problem solving </p>
