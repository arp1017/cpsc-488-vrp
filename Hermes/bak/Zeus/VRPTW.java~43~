 *            constructor that runs the VRPTW class.
 *            calls readVRPTWTokenFileData to read in the input
 *            data, and assigns all shipments to trucks using
 *            mainDepots.insertShipmentVRPTW, and writes all
 *            solutions to output files.
 *         readVRPTWTokenFileData

 * <p>Title: Zeus - Unified Object Oriented Model for Routeing and Schdeduling Problems</p>
 * <p>Description:  The VRPTW, Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, consists of one
 *    depot used in solving a routing problem. A set of customers are to be serviced from
 *    the depot using trucks. The objective of the problem
 *    is to service the customers by first minimizing the total number of trucks
 *    and second minimizing the total distance traveled by the trucks. The constraints
 *    is not to exceed the total capacity of the truck and to service each customer
